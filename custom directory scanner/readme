Goal: Write a program to display information about files in directories recursively, a little bit like the standard Linux system command ls but with different formatting.
The program will accept a single command-line argument, which is intended to be a path to a directory. For the given directory, and each of the directories contained within it recursively, print the path to the directory and a list of the regular files in it.
Note the following requirements:
Within a directory, list files in descending numeric order by file size.
For each file, print the file name, size, and last modification timestamp.
Format the output clearly. (See below for one possible format.)
You may not use the ls program (or similar) at all in your solution.
